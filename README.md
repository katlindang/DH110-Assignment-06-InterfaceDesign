# DH110-Assignment-06-InterfaceDesign

## Description

The goal of this project is to redesign a music learning app called "Learning Music Ableton" to make it easier to use and navigate for middle-aged men. The purpose of Learning Music Ableton is to help users of all skill levels to learn how to make electronic music at their own pace. The current app doesn't allow users to save their progress or navigate within the app easily. With the redesign, users will be able to access saved pages and create a fun interface that will make users interested to use the app. 

The purpose of this interface design project is to develop the style of the app. We will be looking at color, shape variation, typographic variation, etc. The designs are based on the Iphone 13 Pro Max screen size and this project was created on Figma.

# Design Decision: 

### Typeface:
> I played around with all three choices for my wirefram and liked each of them. I chose Lexend over the others because it looks simple and modern. I didn't choose Bebas Neue because it was too bold and made the letters look crowded and cramped together. Although I liked Lato, Lexend had a slight advantage because of the letter spacing and roundness of the letters.

### Color Scheme 

Since my demographics are mostly middle-aged men, I wanted to choose a darker color. I liked the idea of a burgundy red color, but dark blue seemed more fitting and relaxing. In addition, studies show that the color blue is linked to better learning situations. I chose orange as a contrast color because it is visually appealing and works well with dark navy colors. 

### Layout Grid

I  had my layout for my wireframe created before I chose my layput grid. However, the layout grid helped me balance and keep my design aligned to fit the layout of a mobile app. The grid helped me create margins so that the text or boxes aren't too close to the edges.
