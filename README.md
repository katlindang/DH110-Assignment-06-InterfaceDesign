# DH110-Assignment-06-InterfaceDesign

## Description

The goal of this project is to redesign a music learning app called "Learning Music Ableton" to make it easier to use and navigate for middle-aged men. The purpose of Learning Music Ableton is to help users of all skill levels to learn how to make electronic music at their own pace. The current app doesn't allow users to save their progress or navigate within the app easily. With the redesign, users will be able to access saved pages and create a fun interface that will make users interested to use the app. 

The purpose of this interface design project is to develop the style of the app. We will be looking at color, shape variation, typographic variation, etc. The designs are based on the Iphone 13 Pro Max screen size and this project was created on Figma.
